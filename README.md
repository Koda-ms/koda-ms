### Hi! My name is Julyanne 👋

Here goes a resume about my student life. Oh! And, on this profile, you can also check some projects I've worked on. 😁

🙋‍♀️ I've started college in 2020 and since the beginning I've gathered good experience about technologies and the mechanisms we may use. 

👩‍💻 During this time, I've participated on projects developed on the disciplines, but also one on extension. 

📚 So far on the course, I'm still learning and enjoying the path, looking forward to getting new knowledge and improvements on skills!

- 🔭 I’m currently a student at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJs and JavaScript!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Front-End development!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can send me an email (julyanne.correia@ufrpe.br)!
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her | Ela/Dela
